Sorting
1. You look at each pair of numbers, going from left to right, and switch the biggest number to the right.
   You continue looping over this way until all the numbers are in order with the highest on the right.

2. We separate the group into smaller groups of 1 or 2 items, sorting those groups, and then merging them 
   back together in the correct order.

3. We select a pivot and then move everything either right or left of the pivot depending on how they compare to it.
